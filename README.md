# Car_Park_System_GUI
I have made a Car Park System using GUI. I have used JAVA Swing library for GUI. You can run the mainScreen.java file to get the project running. I have used the Object Oriented Programming approach to make this system. The functionality involves multiple GUI Panels like the user Login, user Signup, Admin Login Panel. Once the user is registered no new user can get the already registered username. One user can park multiple cars. There are 3 levels with Level 1 having 15 slots, Level 2 having 10 slots, Level 3 having 5 slots. They display occupied or available based on their real time status.Make sure to give it a test and try it yourself it contains multiple files but run the main screen file. I have used different packages to group related files. 
Their is Inheritance, Polymorphism, Composition, Typecasting between objects, Dynamic binding as the core concepts of OOP that have been utilized. File handling has been used to save all data.
To login into admin panel the username is admin123 and password is 123
